ROG Theta7.1 is also the industry's first to have the AI-powered noise-cancelling microphone that ensures unmatched crystal-clear in-game communication.

The customizable RGB lighting lets you shine in style, and the award-winning quality build and ergonomic design let you wear with comfort and durability.</p>\n<p><strong>Unbeatable 7.1 surround sound with virtual bass driver</strong><br>\nInstead of five smaller, bass-compromising drivers, ROG Theta 7.1's innovative design features four larger discrete Essence drivers in each ear cup to deliver full-spectrum, 7.1-channel surround sound with incredible fidelity and powerful virtual bass. With in-game sounds accurately positioned in 3D space, you'll hear the origin of every gunshot and footstep, bringing the battlefield to life for an unparalleled, immersive gaming experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Exclusive ROG home-theater-grade 7.1 DAC and four ESS 9601 headphone drivers</strong><br>\nROG Theta 7.1 comes with a customized ROG home-theater-grade 7.1 DAC with the SupremeFX S1220A audio codec. Unlike other true 7.1 headsets that use a single amplifier to power multiple drivers, the DAC in ROG Theta 7.1 feeds to four ESS 9601 headphone amps to deliver pinpoint placement of effects within a vast aural landscape. Even with its high-performance home-theater-grade DAC, ROG Theta 7.1 stays cool and comfortable to wear due to a temperature-reducing thermal compound that efficiently dissipates heat.</p>\n<p><strong>AI-powered noise-cancelling microphone</strong><br>\nROG Theta 7.1 comes with the world's first AI-powered noise-cancelling microphone, which features a dedicated processor loaded with smart profiles trained by AI to eliminate over 50-million types of background noise while preserving vocal harmonics for crystal-clear in-game voice communication. This smart mic reduces distracting chatter, keyboard clatter and mouse clicks by up to 95%, allowing you to communicate clearly in any environment. Additionally, the detachable, unidirectional microphone is certified by both Discord and TeamSpeak, and an indicator light on the tip of the boom flashes red when the microphone is muted, letting you easily see the microphone's status.</p>\n<p><strong>ASUS Aura RGB Lighting</strong><br>\nShow your style with customizable Aura RGB lighting. ROG Theta 7.1 comes with captivating lighting effects built-in to the glowing ROG logo.

Upgraded with a new, softer material, these cushions combine specialized, fast-cooling fabric and 100% protein leather for exceptional comfort and sound isolation. The fast-cooling design reduces heat by 25%, keeping you cooler during long gaming sessions. The cushions also feature an ergonomic reverse D-shape with optimized clamping force, for a firm, comfortable fit. The chamber also houses the front drivers, for realistic sound delivery.</p>\n<p><strong>Two types of fit and feel</strong><br>\nROG Theta 7.1 comes with two types of ROG Hybrid ear cushions, so you can choose the fit and feel that's best for you. One pair combines protein leather and fast-cooling, breathable fabric mesh, and thin and soft – perfect for on-the-go gaming. The second pair is thicker but adds more fast-cooling fabric for extended comfort, making them ideal for marathon sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal ear cup and instant controls</strong><br>\nROG Theta 7.1 comes with an aluminum-alloy ear cup and yoke design that provides better heat dissipation and durability to stand up to the rigors of gaming and long-term use. A one-touch button lets you toggle instantly between surround and stereo sound, while a durable rocker switch adjusts output volume, microphone input and even the RGB lighting – putting essential controls right under your fingertip.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplatform compatibility</strong><br>\nWith a USB-C connector that enables wide compatibility with PC, Mac, mobile devices, PlayStation 4* and Nintendo Switch, you'll enjoy high-fidelity output anywhere with ease.</p>\n<p>*Using USB-C to USB 2.0 adapter cable.

The weaves are tight and precise which makes the quality control spectacular.</p>\n<p>Artisan Zero. Gives the most control, is the most popular, slowest of them all, and is used by many professional players. The mousepad can be compared to the likes of Zowie G-SR/SteelSeries QCK. Perfect for very precise aimers that need the crosshair to go exactly where it needs to go. This is the endgame mousepad for a lot of gamers. It's easy to handle and is not affected by sweat or humidity. Designed for players who like control and stability.</p>\n<p>Artisan mousepads have 3 different levels of firmness when it comes to each model. They are Mid, Soft, and Extra Soft. These 3 give different feelings when using the mousepad. Some things to consider with this is firmness &amp; speed + stopping power. For example, Xsoft has more cushion which gives more control and stopping power. The mid-mousepad is thinner and harder which improves speed.</p>\n<p>All Artisan mousepads last longer if you take care of them. Having a mousepad brush is recommended by us at MaxGaming.</p>\n",
